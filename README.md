🚗 Car Price Prediction Model
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the price of a used car based on factors like car brand, model, fuel type, age, and kilometers driven. The model is built using XGBoost Regressor, and the web interface is powered by Flask.

📌 Features
✅ Predicts car prices based on input parameters
✅ Uses XGBoost Regressor for high accuracy
✅ Web-based UI using Flask & HTML/CSS
✅ Interactive dropdowns for car brand & model
✅ Deployed locally or on cloud platforms

📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains the following features:

Name (Car Model)
Company (Brand)
Year (Car Age)
Kms Driven
Fuel Type
Price (Target Variable)
Data was cleaned, preprocessed, and encoded before training the model.

🛠 Technologies Used
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)
🔹 Flask (For Web App)
🔹 HTML / CSS (For Frontend)
🔹 Matplotlib / Seaborn (For Data Visualization)
🔹 GitHub (Version Control)
